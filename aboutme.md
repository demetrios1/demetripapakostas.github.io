My name is Demetrios Papakostas.  I am a 4th year PhD student in statistics at Arizona State University.  I've had the great privelege of working with [Richard Hahn](https://math.la.asu.edu/~prhahn/) for the last 4 years as my doctoral advisor.  I consider myself an applied statistician (who delves in methodological work a bit) and would love a career in data science.  





What else do you need?

### Bio

I grew up in the northeast US to Greek parents.  After high school, I attended Villanova University from 2014-2018, majoring in physics (and technically math).  Although I will always appreciate learning physics, it turns out it was not the right career choice.  So, I made a pivot to a sort of adjacent field and flew out across the country to study statistics at Arizona State University.  

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
